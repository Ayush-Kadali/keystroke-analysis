# **Keystroke Analysis for User Identification: Project Review**

*Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems (AIES) Mini Project*

## **1\. Project Overview**

This project aims to develop an intelligent system that can identify users based on their keystroke dynamics. The system will analyze patterns in how users type—including keystroke timing, and rhythm—to create a biometric profile that can be used for identification and authentication purposes.

## **2\. Project Objectives**

* Develop AI models that can accurately identify users based on their typing patterns  
* Compare multiple classification approaches to determine optimal performance  
* Implement an expert system component for final authentication decisions  
* Create a system that can adapt UI elements based on identified users  
* Demonstrate practical applications of AI concepts covered in the AIES curriculum

## **3\. Methodology**

### **3.1 Data Acquisition**

The project will use a custom Python-based keylogger to collect keystroke data, including:

* Key press and release timings  
* Keystroke latency (time between consecutive keys)  
* Key hold duration (dwell time)  
* Special key usage patterns (shift, backspace, etc.)  
* Application context

This data collection system is being developed as part of the Data Engineering Concepts project and will provide the necessary training dataset.

### **3.2 Feature Extraction**

From raw keystroke data, the following features will be extracted:

* Digraph and trigraph latencies (timing between common two or three letter combinations)  
* Average typing speed and rhythm  
* Error correction patterns (backspace usage)  
* Special key usage frequencies  
* Statistical measures (mean, standard deviation, etc.) of timing patterns
